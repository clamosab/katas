# katas
Kata's repository that I've been practicing to share and learn.

The "0-java-project-junit5-template" is a template to make things easy using java and junit5. This is a copy of the code hosted on [kata-bootstraps](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps) (Visit this repository to use others test frameworks or others languajes)

The "1-fizbuzz" is a folder with multiple attempts of the FizzBuzz kata.
